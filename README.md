# Big Structural Code
## This is a repo of some of the work I did as a data intern with Iowa for Warren.
This repo was formerly private, but seeing as the primary and general are both over I am making it public so future progressive campaigns can use anything that may be useful.
Unfortunately, much of the code I wrote I cannot find, but I have saved here what is still on my computer.
